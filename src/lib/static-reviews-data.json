      "review": "I drove past Anne's Shop while driving past Springvale Shopping Centre. I called Anne to ask if she could help my pre-teen daughters with shaping their eyebrows. I had tried to shape them but couldn't make them even and had visited other salon's but was not happy with the service. She was friendly and accommodating and so I booked an appointment. My kids were nervous, but she was engaging and friendly and did such an amazing job with their brows! When they walked out, the difference to their faces was incredible. The shape of their brows lifted their faces, and it was done within minutes.\n\nHighly recommended Anne! She knows her craft, and I am so thankful that I found her.\n\nAA++ (Springvale location)",

She has given my eyebrows a wonderful shape and I feel so much more confident in my appearance. In addition to being a skilled artist, Anne is warm and engaging, and I have no hesitation in recommending her. Given what she had to work with, she is absolutely brilliant, and I am so grateful to her. (Richmond location)",

Anne will sit you down and make you comfortable before anything goes permanent. I also splurged and got my eyelash extensions done at the same time! I was surprised how fast and efficient she is.\n\nAnne is 10/10 amazing, friendly and professional. She is very honest in her work and takes pride in what she does. (Springvale location)",

I have not been one to invest in my appearance from a cosmetic perspective and had expected something as drastic as a face tattoo would be quite daunting but Anne ensured it was quite the opposite. She stepped me through each stage at a pace and style I was comfortable with. I have just been for a 12 month touch up and its like catching up with an old friend with a side of eyebrow perfection. Cannot recommend highly enough. (Richmond location)",

Anne talked me through everything and told me what she would recommend. She made my brows even, a lovely arch, full and designed everything to match my face shape and enhance it. This is hands done the best thing I have decided to do. Anne has boosted my confidence. I honestly can‚Äôt wait to see her again. Highly recommended!! (Richmond location)",
