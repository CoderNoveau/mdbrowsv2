She has given my eyebrows a wonderful shape and I feel so much more confident in my appearance. In addition to being a skilled artist, Anne is warm and engaging, and I have no hesitation in recommending her. Given what she had to work with, she is absolutely brilliant, and I am so grateful to her.",

    text: "Anne is gorgeous, she has been so patient with me throughout my eyebrow microblading journey. I have not been one to invest in my appearance from a cosmetic perspective and had expected something as drastic as a face tattoo would be quite daunting but Anne ensured it was quite the opposite. She stepped me through each stage at a pace and style I was comfortable with. I have just been for a 12 month touch up and its like catching up with an old friend with a side of eyebrow perfection. Cannot recommend highly enough.",

    text: "It takes trust and courage to let someone make changes to your face, but I'm so glad I put my trust in Anne! I've had my brows micro-bladed, they were pretty unsymmetrical to begin with so I'm amazed at how even she's managed to get them, and the colour match is perfect. I never have to do my brows in the morning anymore, and they look more natural!",

    text: "Absolutely amazing experience! Anne is fabulous. I have been very insecure about my eyebrows for years and finally decided to get microblading done. Anne talked me through everything and told me what she would recommend. She made my brows even, a lovely arch, full and designed everything to match my face shape and enhance it. This is hands done the best thing I have decided to do. Anne has boosted my confidence. I honestly can't wait to see her again. Highly recommended!!",
