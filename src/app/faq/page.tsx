      question: "What is Microblading?",
      answer: "Microblading is a sophisticated semi-permanent cosmetic tattooing technique used to create fuller, natural-looking eyebrows. This precision artistry involves the use of a specialized handheld microblade to manually draw delicate hair-like strokes that blend into your existing eyebrow hair for natural, beautiful results."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the procedure take?",
      answer: "For the first Microblading session, the entire procedure usually takes about 2-3 hours. This includes consultation, brow mapping, numbing, and the actual microblading process."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does microblading last?",
      answer: "Microblading typically lasts 12-24 months, depending on your skin type, lifestyle, and aftercare. Oily skin types may fade faster, while dry skin tends to retain the pigment longer."
    },
    {
      question: "Does microblading hurt?",
      answer: "Most clients experience minimal discomfort during microblading. We use topical numbing cream to ensure your comfort throughout the procedure. Many describe the sensation as similar to eyebrow plucking."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the healing process like?",
      answer: "The healing process takes about 4-6 weeks. Initially, brows will appear darker and more defined, then gradually lighten as they heal. Proper aftercare is crucial for optimal results."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does microblading cost?",
      answer: "Our microblading starts from $595, which includes the initial treatment and complimentary touch-up session within 6-8 weeks. We offer package deals and payment plans for your convenience."
    },
    {
      question: "Am I a good candidate for microblading?",
      answer: "Most people are good candidates for microblading. However, we don't recommend the procedure for pregnant or breastfeeding women, those on blood-thinning medications, or people with certain skin conditions. A consultation will determine your suitability."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I avoid before my appointment?",
      answer: "Avoid alcohol, caffeine, blood-thinning medications, and sun exposure 24-48 hours before your appointment. Don't pluck, wax, or tint your eyebrows for at least one week prior to your session."

            <h3 className="faq-question">What is Microblading?</h3>
            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Microblading is a sophisticated semi-permanent cosmetic tattooing technique used to create fuller, natural-looking eyebrows. This precision artistry involves the use of a specialized handheld microblade to manually draw delicate hair-like strokes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although microblading is considered a form of eyebrow tattooing, the difference is that every hair stroke is drawn by the artist with a handheld microblade. Each stroke is manually shaped and blended into the client&apos;s existing eyebrow hair which results in natural, beautiful eyebrows.
              </p>

              <p>
                For the first Microblading session, the entire procedure usually takes about 2-3 hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this session, we will shape and style your brows and answer any questions you may have. We then follow with pigment colour selection. Once you are satisfied with the design and colour choice, we begin the procedure.
              </p>

            <h3 className="faq-question">Is microblading painful?</h3>
            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                The pain level for the procedure is considered mild to none. Prior to the procedure we will apply a topical anesthetic to numb the area, and we&apos;ll continue to apply anesthetic throughout the entire procedure to ensure your comfort level is maintained.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike many other studios, we prioritize your comfort by continuously reapplying numbing throughout the entire procedureâ€”not just at the beginning. This comprehensive approach to pain management is so effective that many of our clients experience minimal discomfort, with some even falling asleep during their treatment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everyone responds differently to anesthetic; depending on the client, the feeling of the procedure has been described as light scratches to not feeling anything. After the procedure, redness and slight swelling in the area is normal. Clients describe the area feeling similar to a light sunburn.
              </p>

          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="faq-question">How long does it take to heal?</h3>
            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                The healing process takes approximately 10-14 days. Initially, your brows will appear 30-40% darker and more defined than the final result. During the first week, you may experience some flaking and scabbing as the skin heals.
              </p>
              <p>
                The eyebrows will go through several phases during healing:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Days 1-3:</strong> Brows appear darker and more defined than the final result</li>
                <li><strong>Days 4-7:</strong> Possible flaking and scabbing as the skin heals</li>
                <li><strong>Days 7-14:</strong> Color may appear lighter as new skin forms</li>
                <li><strong>Weeks 2-4:</strong> True color gradually develops as the pigment settles</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                No down time is required after microblading procedure. It takes approximately 7-14 days for the brows to heal over, and about 1 month for the colour to fully set in.

            <h3 className="faq-question">Why do I need a touch-up session?</h3>
            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                A touch up session after 6-8 weeks is necessary as everyone heals differently and outcomes will vary. This critical follow-up session allows us to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Assess how your skin has retained the pigment</li>
                <li>Fill in any areas that may need more definition</li>
                <li>Make adjustments to perfect the shape and density</li>
                <li>Ensure symmetry and overall natural appearance</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Certain areas may not pick up during first session and will need to be refilled. Pigment colour may need to be adjusted, brow thickness and more strokes can be added. Individuals with oily skin often require a deeper shade during the touch up session as the oils tend to lighten the pigment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most importantly, your touch up session is when we refine your brows to ensure it looks perfect and retains the colour for as long as possible.
              </p>

            <h3 className="faq-question">How long does microblading last?</h3>
            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Microblading is a semi-permanent treatment that typically lasts between 12 to 24 months, depending on individual factors like skin type, lifestyle, and personal skincare routine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since microblading pigments are not implanted into the skin as deep as traditional tattoos, the area will naturally fade overtime. Clients with oily skin will find that their brows will fade faster and may need more regular touch-ups.
              </p>
              <p>
                The longevity of your microbladed brows also depends on factors such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Your body&apos;s natural metabolism of the pigment</li>
                <li>Exposure to environmental factors like sun and pollution</li>
                <li>Your adherence to aftercare instructions</li>
                <li>The quality of pigments used (we use only premium, long-lasting pigments)</li>
                <li>The depth of pigment placement during the procedure</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                To maintain the brows looking fresh, a touch up is recommended every 12-18 months depending on your skin type.

          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="faq-question">What&apos;s the difference between microblading and machine brows/powder brows?</h3>
            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Microblading uses a manual hand tool to create fine, hair-like strokes, resulting in a natural appearance. Machine brows or powder brows (also called OmbrÃ© Brows) use a digital machine to implant pigment, creating a softer, shaded effect similar to brow powder makeup.
              </p>
              <p>
                Powder brows typically last longer than microblading and may be better for oily skin but provide a more filled-in look rather than the defined hair strokes of microblading.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Signature Combo Brows combine both techniques to achieve the most natural and dimensional brow look possible, offering the best of both worlds.

          <div className="faq-item">
            <h3 className="faq-question">What is cosmetic tattooing and how long does it last?</h3>
            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Cosmetic tattooing, also known as permanent makeup, involves the controlled insertion of safe color pigments into the skin to enhance features like eyebrows, lips, and eyes. Results typically last 1-3 years depending on the treatment area, your skin type, lifestyle, and aftercare.
              </p>
              <p>
                Specific longevity varies by procedure:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Lip blushing generally lasts 2-3 years</li>
                <li>Eyeliner 3-5 years</li>
                <li>Brow treatments 1-3 years</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Factors that can affect longevity include sun exposure, skincare routines containing exfoliants or retinol, and how your body processes the pigment. Touch-ups are recommended every 12-18 months to maintain optimal results.

            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                At Melbourne Designer Brows, we prioritize your comfort during cosmetic tattooing procedures. We apply a topical numbing cream before beginning and, unlike many other studios, we continuously reapply numbing throughout the entire procedureâ€”not just at the beginning.

              <p>
                This comprehensive approach to pain management is so effective that many of our clients experience minimal discomfort, with some even falling asleep during their treatment. The level of discomfort varies by procedure and individual pain tolerance, with eyeliner typically being more sensitive than lip or brow treatments.

            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Tattoo removal involves some discomfort, often described as a sensation similar to a rubber band snapping against the skin or a warm pinprick feeling. At Melbourne Designer Brows, we prioritize your comfort by applying premium numbing cream 30 minutes before your treatment begins.
              </p>
              <p>
                This significantly reduces discomfort during the procedure. Most clients find the process very tolerable, especially compared to getting the original tattoo.

              <p>
                The number of sessions required varies significantly based on several factors:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Tattoo age (older tattoos typically require fewer sessions)</li>
                <li>Ink colors (black and dark blue respond best)</li>
                <li>Tattoo depth and density</li>
                <li>Location on the body (areas with better circulation respond faster)</li>
                <li>Individual factors like skin type and immune system function</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                On average, most clients require 6-10 sessions for significant removal, though this can range from 3-15 sessions in total. During your consultation, we&apos;ll provide a more specific estimate based on your particular tattoo.

              <p>
                While our advanced technology can effectively target most ink colors, some colors respond better than others:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Black, dark blue, and red typically respond well to laser treatment</li>
                <li>Green, yellow, and white can be more challenging and may require more sessions</li>
                <li>Some colors may not completely disappear but can be significantly faded</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                During your consultation, we&apos;ll assess your specific tattoo colors and provide realistic expectations for the removal process.

                Proper aftercare is essential for optimal results and minimizing potential side effects after tattoo removal. We will provide specific instructions for your situation, but the general guidelines include:
              </p>
              <p><strong>Immediate Aftercare (First 48 Hours):</strong></p>
              <ul>

            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                After your initial session, your treated area will go through several phases of healing:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Days 1-2:</strong> The treated area appears darker and more defined</li>
                <li><strong>Days 3-7:</strong> You may experience some flaking or scabbing</li>
                <li><strong>Days 7-14:</strong> The color appears lighter as the skin heals</li>
                <li><strong>Days 14-30:</strong> The pigment settles and true color emerges</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The final results will be visible after the touch-up session and complete healing, usually about 30 days after your touch-up appointment.
              </p>
              <p>
                For tattoo removal, results are progressive with each session. You'll notice gradual fading after each treatment, with optimal results usually visible 4-8 weeks after your final session.

            <h3 className="faq-question">What is Microneedling and how does it work?</h3>
            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Microneedling is a minimally invasive cosmetic procedure that creates tiny punctures in the top layer of the skin using micro-fine needles. These micro-injuries trigger the body's natural wound healing processes, resulting in increased cell turnover and collagen production.
              </p>
              <p>
                This treatment is effective for improving skin texture, reducing fine lines, minimizing scarring, and creating a more youthful appearance. Multiple sessions are typically recommended for optimal results.

            <div className="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Eyebrow correction is a specialized service for clients who have received unsatisfactory results from previous microblading or tattooing procedures. This might include uneven shape, poor color choice, or faded, discolored results.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our correction services can:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Reshape uneven or asymmetrical brows</li>
                <li>Correct unflattering colors</li>
                <li>Fix harsh, unnatural-looking strokes</li>
                <li>Address migration or blurring of pigment</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Depending on the condition of your current brows, correction may involve color neutralization, removal techniques, or a completely new application. During your consultation, we'll assess your specific situation and recommend the best approach.
